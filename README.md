# MVVM


A small experiment implementing [MVVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel) with [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa).

## Motiviation

We were discussing the merits of switching to MVVM over MVC. So what better way than to get your hands dirty and write some code.

## Requirements

To get started, check out the project, cd into the MVVM directory and

```bash
$ pod install
```

And then build the code using your IDE of choice.

For the network layer there's a small project running up on heroku that serves static JSON so no need to run anything locally. If you want however, you can also just switch into the Web directory and

```bash
$ foreman start
```

And that's that.

## TODO

* Setup the other views. The collection view is the only functional one right now.
